## Introduction

How do you write blog posts? Wordpress, â€¦
In my case I used to have an admin panel in my website where I could author posts. But when I moved to JAMstack I lose that ability since all of the counted was stored in Git repositories and I left with ability to use GitHub website, VS Code or something different up until now. 

## Birth of the idea

I started thinking about the idea of my new side project in late of Fall 2020. The main driver was the dislike of some core principals of OneNote, at that moment the primary note-taking app for my personal needs.
I like everything to be in order, to match styles and it's not an easy task when you deal with such apps like OneNote. When you paste the text from the browser it will preserve all the styles including font colors, font sizes, etc. As a result you will end-up when all of your notes look different. You may see echoing of style preserving also when you loot at your notes on mobile devices, and see horizontal scroll to appear, where I would only expect vertical scrolling. The second annoying thing for me is that it's too easy to changes something, I had several times when I changed the notes by accident with removing part of the text, and then realizing it after some time. Don't put me wrong, OneNote is amazing application it has a lot of strengths like supporting real-time collaboration, writing with stylus and many more. But those benefits are not really important for me and disadvantages appeared to overweight everything else.
