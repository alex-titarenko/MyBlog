## Introduction

Hello my friend. May I assume that some of you also may write blog posts? Then the next question for you, how do you author them, what tool/platform do you use? WordPress, Blogger, Medium, anything else?
Since I'm software developer and not always try to find easy and straightforward path, I developed my own simple blogging system where all of the blog posts are stored in Git repository as markdown files. During the build process they will be compiled into HTML files to easy serve from CDN. In this approach there is one single problem, it may not be the most pleasant way to change or create blog post from VS Code or GitHub website.
Luckily, my recently developed tool [NotesHub](https://noteshub.app) solved this puzzle, and this post is meant to open the curtain behind my new project.

## Birth of the idea

I started thinking about the idea of my new side project in late Fall 2020. The main driver was the dislike of some core principals of OneNote, at that moment the primary note-taking app for my personal needs.
I like everything to be in order, to match styles and it's not an easy task when you deal with such apps like OneNote. When you copy-paste a text from the browser it will preserve all the styles including font colors, font sizes, etc. As a result you will end-up when all of your notes look different. You may see echoing of style preserving also when you look at your notes on mobile device, and see horizontal scroll to appear, where I would only expect vertical scrolling. The second annoying thing for me is that it's too easy to change something, I had several times when I changed the notes by accident and then realizing it too late. Don't put me wrong, OneNote is amazing application. It has a lot of strengths like supporting real-time collaboration, writing with stylus and many more, however those benefits are not really important for me and disadvantages appeared to overweight everything else.

## Implementation

I the last day before going to vacation in Cancun, I made the final commit to finalize MVP version of the project and ending the 6 month journey from the idea to first stable version. Project was available to public.
