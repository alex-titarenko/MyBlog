## Introduction

How do you write blog posts? Wordpress, â€¦
In my case I used to have an admin panel in my website where I could author posts. But when I moved to JAM stack I lose that ability since all of the counted was stored in Git repositories and I left with ability to use GitHub website, VS Code or something different up until now. 

## Birth of the idea

## Implementation

## The future of the project
