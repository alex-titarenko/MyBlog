## Introduction

How do you write blog posts? Wordpress, â€¦
In my case I used to have an admin panel in my website where I could author posts. But when I moved to JAM stack I lose that ability since all of the counted was stored in Git repositories and I left with ability to use GitHub website, VS Code or something different up until now. 

## Birth of the idea

I started thinking about the idea of my new side project in late of Fall 2020. The main driver was the dislike of some core principals of OneNote, at that moment the primary note-taking app for my personal needs.

## Implementation

## The road ahead
